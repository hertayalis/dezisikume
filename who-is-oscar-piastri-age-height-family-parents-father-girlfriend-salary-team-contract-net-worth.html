The youngster recently secured a deal with McLaren for the 2023 season, and replaces his fellow countryman Daniel Ricciardo.</p><h4><strong>Oscar Piastri brief bio and career highlights</strong></h4><p>Oscar Jack Piastri is an Australian F1 racing driver who was born on 6 April 2001 in Melbourne, Australia. Australia, Piastri began karting back in 2011 and eventually finished third in the Australian Kart Championship in 2015.</p><p>In 2016, Oscar left karting to join the Formula 4 UAE Championship with sponsorship from his father‚Äôs company HP Tuners. Piastri then moved to UK to take part in the Formula 4 British Championship where he finished second in 2017.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The young Australian driver won his first major racing championship victory in 2019 when he won the 2019 Formula Renault Eurocup with R-ace GP. Following the win, he progressed onto Formula 3 in 2020 where he won the FIA Formula 3 Championship. He further went on to win the 2021 Formula 2 Championship with Prema Racing.</p><p>Piastri impressed everyone with his dominating performances as he finished his F2 campaign with a total of 252.5 points. He had a 60.5 points lead ahead of his nearest challenger Robert Shwartzman.</p><p>Zhou Guanyu, finished in third place in the standings that year. However, interestingly, &nbsp;he managed to secure a driver role in the 2022 F1 season ahead of Piastri by securing a deal with Alfa Romeo.</p><h4><strong>Age and height</strong></h4><p>Oscar Piastri is currently just 21 years old and stands at a height of 178cm. Chris Piastri and Nicole Piastri are Oscar Piastri‚Äôs parents. The name of Piastri‚Äôs mystery girlfriend is Lily Zneime.</p><h4><strong>Oscar net worth and salary</strong></h4><p>According to various sources, Oscar Piastri currently has an estimated net worth of around $1.5 million dollars in 2023. This includes all his endorsements with Quad Lock, THG, HP Tuners, and his salary earnings. Following his new contract with the McLaren F1 team, the 21-year-old earns an annual salary of $750,000.</p><h4><strong>Oscar Piastri manager</strong></h4><p>Oscar Piastri‚Äôs manager is the former F1 driver and fellow Australian Mark Webber. Webber runs JAM Sports Management alongside his partner Ann and is also one of the founders of the management group.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h4><strong>Oscar Piastri role at Alpine</strong></h4><p>Despite his impressive and dominant rise to the coming off consecutive championship victory in the F3 and F2, Piastri wasn‚Äôt given a spot on the F1 starting grid in 2022. Alpine instead handed a reserve driver role to the rising star.</p><p>Since he was an existing member of the Alpine Driver Academy, the move seemed like a logical fit for Oscar. He was on standby to replace any of the team‚Äôs full-time drivers ‚Äì Fernando Alonso or Esteban Ocon in the case of an injury or any other incident that made them unfit for the race on any given weekend.</p><p>Oscar also travelled with the team to each race venue and sat in on every driver meetings. However, Piastri‚Äôs services were not required during the 2022 season. As such, he entirely stopped travelling with Alpine after confirmation his new contract with McLaren for 2023.</p><h4><strong>Oscar Piastri contract standoff with Alpine</strong></h4><p>Piastri‚Äôs decision to sign a new contract with McLaren brought out a lot of controversies and complications. Back in August last year, Piastri was initially announced as an Alpine driver. Alpine driver Fernando Alonso decided not to extend his contract with the team and instead join Aston Martin in 2023.</p><p>However, the Australian did not take the announcement well and disputed the issue in public. Piastri wrote on social media:</p><p>I understand that, without my agreement, Alpine F1 have put out a press release late this afternoon that I am driving for them next year‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThis is wrong and I have not signed a contract with Alpine for 2023. I will not be driving for Alpine next year.‚Äù</p><p>Alpine in response decided to take up the matter to the Contract Recognition Board. The team argued that they already had a valid contract in place with Piastri. However, McLaren were eventually declared to have secured a legal contract with Piastri. As such, the situation turned out in favour of Piastri and his new team McLaren.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Oscar Piastri replaces fellow Australian Daniel Ricciardo for the F1 2023 season. This comes after Daniel mutually agreed to cut his three-year contract short with McLaren.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ALSO READ: Who is Jerome Tang Kansas State coach, age, family, wife, son, salary, contract</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ec6smpqqXaW2or%2FTq6BmmZeaeqmxyKCfrWWWlrqquNhmp5qqlaPBtHnFmquhnaJitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXq0rcuaqbJlpJqurnnCqKWtqpGYwW66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./twitter-reacts-to-harry-styles-olivia-wilde-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Best Twitter Reactions to Harry Styles &amp;amp; Olivia Wilde Dating">&larr;
