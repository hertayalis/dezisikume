Mainstream media outlets and even social media sites, like YouTube, have vowed to halt the publication of materials that suggest, without "evidence" that the election was indeed "rigged", as President Donald Trump tweeted.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump has yet to concede defeat in the election to Joe Biden, and there are still multitudes of people who are constantly contending that there was indeed some "tomfoolery" going on with voting, which is why Melania Trump is making headlines for reportedly planning her exit from the White House to enjoy a more private lifestyle.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Business Insider reported that "sources close to the first lady told the outlet that she'd been preparing her move to Trump's Mar-a-Lago house in Palm Beach, Florida and that "she just wants to go home."</p><p>These reports come in tandem with other stories of Trump planning renovations to the Florida property, along with his plans to leave the White House on Biden's Inauguration day aboard Air Force One.</p><p>Sources also indicated that Trump plans on holding a rally in Florida at the time same of Biden's inauguration speech in a bid to pull viewers away from the President-Elect.</p><p>It's been said that Melania has sent large shipments to both the Trump's New York and Florida properties and plans on leveraging her title as First Lady tenure into a career as a public figure.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>History continues to unfold at the <a href=#>@WhiteHouse</a> & I am pleased to announce the completion of the tennis pavilion.

There isn't such a fund, however.</p><p>There's also been a lot of speculation as to Melania Trump's discontent with being First Lady. Rumors that the Slovenian-Born model was having an affair with Henry "Hank" Siemers, the head of security at the Tiffany's jewelry store at Trump Tower. That, and her NY lifestyle was reportedly the reasoning behind Melania's disappointment with Trump's decision to run for President.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The <a href=#>@WhiteHouse</a> Cross Hall & Grand Foyer overflow with love, joy, peace, hope & faith, revealing the most important gifts of the season.
