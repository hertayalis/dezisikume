There was also a suggestion that her subsequent role as Commander Clare Blake on ITV's The Commander was a driving force behind her move.</p><p id=e8XN58rTGIAS data-wc=30>It was also reported at the time that there were tensions and "clashes" behind the scenes between Amanda and crew members. However, this was never explained fully by those involved.</p><p id=epPs7aM-ePE_ data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Silent Witness: Viewers spot major blunder in series 25</a></strong></p><p id=emHhyGxTuzlA data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Silent Witness viewers left worried for beloved character in 25th series return</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/49ce58408204-amanda-new-z.jpg><p id=eVcZ24DktIy4 data-wc=5><strong>Amanda Burton returned in 2022</strong></p><h2>Liz Carr</h2><p id=e6WfoRbJ_lrf data-wc=43>Liz Carr left Silent Witness following the series 23 finale.

Thanks for everyone's love & support - you are the best."</p><p id=eO38zod_10IU data-wc=76>Liz further elaborated in a statement which read: "To quote Clarissa, 'I just know, deep down – that it’s time for me to move on, to focus less on the dead and more on the living. On life'. Silent Witness has given me such an amazing opportunity to develop as an actor but I know this is the right time to take a leap of faith, leaving what I know and seeing what other opportunities await."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/46648367f35a-liz-carr-z.jpg><p id=elby1UqQoXlc data-wc=5><strong>Liz Carr left in 2020</strong></p><h2>Richard Lintern</h2><p id=eaXL5qqrwMua data-wc=55>Richard appeared on Silent Witness from series 17 until the final episode of series 23 – where his character, Thomas Chamberlain, died while investigating a case involving a nerve agent.

He said in a statement: "I have had a fantastic time on the show but feel now is the appropriate time to move on hopefully to other ventures."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4abdee7fba80-william-silent-witness-z.jpg><p id=eSL7kOkof7hK data-wc=6><strong>William Gaminara appeared in many series</strong></p><h2>Tom Ward</h2><p id=eihoMrxH-xlE data-wc=49>Similar to Emilia Fox and William Gaminara, Tom Ward, who played Harry Cunningham, was one of Silent Witness' longest standing cast members. His character first trained under Dr Sam Ryan before her departure and, when she came on the scene, began an on-off relationship with Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox).</p><p id=e0uiK04IHnWR data-wc=32>In the show, Harry decided to move to New York to accept a professorship. In real life, Tom decided after ten years on the show it was "the right time" to leave.</p><p id=eLpzZygBmEid data-wc=39>The drama's writer, Tim Prager, said: "When Tom Ward decided it was time for him to leave Silent Witness, he left with the gratitude of everyone involved in the show for the contribution he had made to its success."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27451d733c11-tom-ward-z.jpg><p id=et77U0I_Ywr3 data-wc=6><strong>Tom Ward [left] exited in 2012</strong></p><h2>Ruth McCabe</h2><p id=e5swyEZThYR0 data-wc=83>Ruth McCabe played Amanda Burton's on-screen sister, Wyn Ryan, and die-hard fans will know that Wyn's relocation to Ireland is one of the reasons behind Sam's move to Ireland upon her departure.

It's not known whether she chose to leave or whether her character was written out of the show, but since then she's gone on to appear in My Left Foot, Catastrophe and Women on the Verge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4be4e7b7cab0-ruth-mccabe-z.jpg><p id=ezDauimEIE7- data-wc=7><strong>Ruth McCabe played Amanda Burton's on-screen sister</strong></p><h2>John McGlynn</h2><p id=e7yVHMxzTOLy data-wc=40>John McGlynn played the part of Detective Chief Inspector Tom Adams in the original cast, however, he only appeared in the show for the first season.
