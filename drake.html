Drake is consistently one of the world’s highest-paid entertainers. Drake began his acting career on the hit Canadian television series “Degrassi: The Next Generation.”</strong></p><p>However, it was music that made him a household name around the world, and he has been writing or recording successful single after successful track since 2006. His debut studio album, “Thank Me Later,” debuted at the top of the hip-hop charts in 2010, and he hasn’t stopped since. He has relentlessly traveled, featured on several music programs and award events, and, in general, worked hard to establish as large a fan base as possible.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Drake?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Drake </a>was born Aubrey Drake Graham in Toronto, Canada on October 24, 1986. Drake’s father, Dennis, was a drummer who collaborated with artists such as Jerry Lee Lewis during his career. Sandra, aka Sandi, Drake’s mother, was an English teacher and florist. Drake went to a Jewish day school and had a ceremonial Bar Mitzvah.</p><p>Aubrey was five years old when Sandi and Dennis split. His father later relocated to Memphis, where he was caught and imprisoned for several years on narcotics charges. Aubrey remained in Toronto with his mother, while he visited his father in Memphis every summer (when his father was not incarcerated). Drake would later describe Dennis as being absent during his upbringing, which Dennis has strongly refuted and alleges was inflated to sell records.</p><p>Drake and his mother resided in the lower half of a two-story townhouse in Forest Hill, an upscale suburb, beginning in sixth grade. Drake lived in the basement, while his mother lived on the street-level floor. They were not wealthy; in fact, money was scarce.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does Drake make per year?</h2><p>The renowned musician earns between $50,000 to $70,000 annually.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What investments does Drake have?</h2><p>Drake Graham’s holdings include premium real estate, high-end automobiles, lavish jewelry, and a private plane.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Endorsement deals does Drake have?</h2><p>He has a profitable deal with Apple Music and is credited with helping the company’s development. He’s also collaborated with Bathing Ape. He’s signed with Nike and, as far as I know, the first hip-hop artist to have his own shoes with Jordan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Philanthropy works has Drake supported?</h2><p>By partnering with LeBron James’ organization, Drake is giving back to the community. The Canadian rapper gave the LeBron James Family Foundation a million dollars in Bitcoin. The LeBron James Family Foundation assists poor students through a variety of activities. Drake claims to have won $1 million through a relationship with Stake.com, an online gambling service he uses.</p><p>According to TMZ, Drake made a “massive bet” on their online roulette tables. As a reward for his roulette move, he received a significant quantity of money.</p><p>A portion of the proceeds were donated to the LeBron James Foundation. The same James was in Toronto last weekend and met Drake at a restaurant called Harbour 60.</p><p>Drake brought a local high school basketball player named Michael with him to the meal. He is a member of the Royal Crown Academy and plans to continue his amateur career in college.</p><p>Drake also gave Michael and his mother $100,000. The donation was documented on social media networks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2pmqOVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./indy-blue-life-story-wealth-age-encyclopedia-family-and-recent-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Indy Blue Life Story, Wealth, Age, Encyclopedia, Family, and Recent News">&larr;
