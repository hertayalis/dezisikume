One of the most vivid memories from this period of his career is when he broke the NCAA record nearly ten years established by Tom Dolan in the 400m individual medley.</span></p><p><span>Ryan’s Olympic debut came in 2008. This edition of the Olympics saw Ryan Lochte win a team gold medal and an individual gold medal and a team and team bronze medal.&nbsp;The professional swimmer continued to collect medals and accolades in the years leading up to the 2012 Olympics in London.&nbsp;He rounded off his efforts in London with 5 medals: two gold.&nbsp;two silver and one bronze.&nbsp;One gold and one silver were individual honours.</span></p><p><span>At the Rio Olympics in 2016, Ryan won another gold medal, bringing his Olympic medal tally to twelve.</span></p><p><span>Ryan’s efforts don’t end in a pool.&nbsp;He appeared on the episodic shows&nbsp;</span><span>30 Rocks</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>90210,</span><span>&nbsp;both in 2012. He also participated with professional dancer Cheryl Burke in the dance show,&nbsp;</span><span>Dancing with the Stars.&nbsp;</span><span>In 2013, he launched his own reality show called&nbsp;</span><span>What Would Ryan Lochte Do?&nbsp;</span><span>It aired one season of eight episodes before being canceled five weeks later.</span></p><p><span>The decorated Olympian has had his share of controversies too.&nbsp;At the Rio Olympics in August 2016, he and teammate Jimmy Feigen claimed they were robbed along with two of their teammates.&nbsp;A police report and surveillance video later dispelled their charges and threatened them with 18 months in prison under Brazilian law.&nbsp;The swimmer ends up serving a 10-month swimming ban.&nbsp;A suspension he says made him stronger.</span></p><h2><strong><span>The family of Ryan Lochte, mom</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ryan’s father, Steven Lochte, is of German, Dutch and English heritage.&nbsp;His mother, Ileana Lochte (formerly Aramburu) was born and raised in Havana, Cuba.&nbsp;He has four siblings;&nbsp;Kristin, Megan, Devon and Brandon.</span></p><p><span>Ryan obviously shares a strong bond with his mother.&nbsp;She showed her penchant for always coming to her son’s defense during an interview on Good Morning America.&nbsp;Illeana defended her son, Ryan’s bleached hair, at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.&nbsp;She said he was the kind of person who liked to do whatever he wanted and she got used to it.&nbsp;Although she admitted she wasn’t a fan of the hair color, she said Ryan looked cute in it.&nbsp;She also said it was much better than the American flag-themed grid he noticed at the previous Olympics.</span></p><p><span>Illeana also helped ignite the fire surrounding the news that her son and his teammates were robbed at the Rio Olympics.&nbsp;She told Fox Sports in an interview that the incident happened at gunpoint.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ryan Lochte’s Relationships – Girlfriend, Gay, Wife, Fiance</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ryan is definitely not gay and may be married now, but he has dated a few other celebrities in the past.&nbsp;In 2011, he was in a relationship with American singer K. Michelle.&nbsp;They ended after about a year of being together.</span></p><p><span>Subsequently, rumors spread that he was dating Australian swimmer Blair Evans.&nbsp;Her mother dispelled the rumor during her 2012 interview with&nbsp;</span><span>US Weekly.&nbsp;</span><span>According to her, Ryan was too focused on his career to think about relationships.</span></p><p><span>During the Rio 2016 Olympics, it became public knowledge that Ryan Lochte was dating Kayla Rae Reid.&nbsp;Kayla is a former Playboy roommate.&nbsp;She was the Playboy Playmate of the Month for July 2015. In October 2016, they got engaged and had a son on June 8, 2017. His name is Caiden Zane Lochte.&nbsp;The couple finally tied the knot in January 2018.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth – How rich is Ryan Lochte?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ryan did well.&nbsp;The veteran Olympian has enough endorsement deals and trade appearances to net him a sizable fortune.&nbsp;He has signed endorsement deals with Speedo, Gillette, Gatorade, Nissan, AT&T, Ralph Lauren, Procter and Gamble and many more.&nbsp;He has also appeared in advertisements promoting the Nissan Altima and has appeared on the covers of&nbsp;</span><span>Vogue, Time, Men’s Journal</span><span>&nbsp;and Men’s&nbsp;</span><span>Health.</span></p><p><span>According to&nbsp;</span><span>Fortune Magazine,</span><span>&nbsp;these extra-curricular activities earned him about $2.3 million before the 2012 Olympics in London.&nbsp;Factor in his numerous medals at the Olympics and other competitions and you’ll see why sources like CelebrityNetWorth put his net worth at $6 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ryan Lochte Body Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>The multi-title holder stands at an impressive and intimidating height of 6ft 2in which translates to 1.88m.&nbsp;His sport and lifestyle have led him to maintain a healthy weight of 88 kg.&nbsp;This keeps him at a chest size of 44 inches, a bicep of 15 inches, and a waist measurement of 34 inches.&nbsp;He also has blue eyes and brown hair.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiqqZa7brjOnJ%2BtnV2XtrB5xqKppZ6inrKvsIygmLJlp56zpnnFopinm5ViurC5jKGcop%2BYqXq4tcqiZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./san-francisco-vagrant-who-hit-ex-fire-boss-with-crowbar-released-after-no-show-by-victim.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="San Francisco vagrant who hit ex-fire boss with crowbar released after no-show by victim">&larr;
