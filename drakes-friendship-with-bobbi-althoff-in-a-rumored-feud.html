Throughout, she seemed indifferent to him, questioning him in an awkward style that has drawn comparisons to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comedian-interviewers</a> Amelia Dimoldenberg and Ziwe.&nbsp;</p><p>In the bed-bound chat, she told Drake she’s never heard any of his music and asked the “Nonstop” rapper questions such as, “Why do you follow so many people on Instagram?” and, “Are you gonna buy me a flight home?”</p><p>Althoff also slammed him as “sad” for drinking during the interview.</p><p>“The idea behind it was it would be a funny thing that you wanted to do it so bad that you bothered him while he was going to bed to do it,” she<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> told Today</a> at the time.</p><p>When she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed Lil Yachty </a>after Drake, Drake called Lil Yachty in the middle of their interview and said, “What’s up, Bobbo?” indicating a continued friendliness between Drake and Althoff.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she’s now<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> unfollowed Drake</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took down</a> the full interview from all her platforms.&nbsp;Only a pair of “shorts” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">remain on her YouTube channel</a>, which boasts 714,000 followers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>This abrupt feud between Althoff and Drake seems to stem from Drake’s concert in Los Angeles on Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>The Post has reached out to reps for both parties for comment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Althoff <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a video of herself</a>&nbsp;last week in the crowd at an apparent Drake show — with her arms crossed, looking grumpy, while everyone around her danced. “Really in my element @ this guy’s concert,” she captioned it.&nbsp;</p><p>Several fans slammed her video.&nbsp;</p><p>“Am I the only one who doesn’t find this humor funny at all?? Idk it comes cringe,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one person said</a> on X, formerly known as Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Another fan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">griped</a>, “She seems so insufferable. Like how is it your personality act to be the most boring and negative person in the room.”&nbsp;</p><p>Another fan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">complained</a>, “Alright, this girl is annoying now. We can surely move on.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Drake in bed chatting with Bobbi Althoff during their interview. <span class=credit>Youtube</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Drake and Bobbi Althoff chatting in bed during their bizarre July interview, which put Althoff in the spotlight. <span class=credit>Youtube</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bobbi Althoff, a mom influencer who abruptly rose to fame. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>By Monday, Althoff’s podcast episode with Drake had been removed from Spotify and her YouTube page, and the two had unfollowed each other on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>Some fans have speculated that Drake was not amused by her “unimpressed” reaction post about his concert, and that’s why they had a falling-out.</p><p>“This Bobby Althoff girl is weird I won’t blame Drake if he got offended, who go to someone’s concert and look like that? Support him like he supported you ho. He gave you relevancy and views,” one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan posted</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, others have speculated that the mutual unfollowing is merely a publicity stunt — because after they unfollowed each other, Althoff wrote a cryptic <a href=#>Instagram</a> story on Monday: “Big announcement coming next Monday. Set a reminder because you guys will not want to miss this. Nine in the morning, someone’s time zone.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Some fans think Drake felt insulted by Bobbi Althoff’s video where she seems unimpressed with his concert. <span class=credit>BACKGRID</span></figure><p>Althoff, who now has over 5 million TikTok followers, has been active since 2021. She began with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posts about her life as a young mom</a>, and only recently pivoted to celebs, also interviewing disgraced <a href=#>YouTuber Colleen Ballinger</a>, Lil Yachty, Mark Cuban, Rick Glassman and YouTuber Funny Marco.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I started my podcast in April, I wanted to do interviews with celebrities, but I didn’t know how I was going to get there. It was really hard to get guests, so I made a video on TikTok saying that I would give $300 to any person who successfully connected me to a celebrity for a podcast,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Cosmopolitan</a>.</p><p>“Rick Glassman, the comedian, was the first person I was able to interview because somebody tagged him, and he was like, ‘Okay, I’ll do it.’ So I sent her $300 and did the episode with Rick Glassman.”</p><p>That’s how she landed Funny Marco, too, she explained.&nbsp;</p><p>“Then I got a random comment on TikTok asking if I had heard of Funny Marco … I took a screenshot of the comment, posted it on my Instagram Stories, and tagged him, saying, ‘Marco, if you want to make this girl $300, DM me.’ He had over 4 million followers at the time, and I only had 500,000. I was like, ‘He’s not going to see this.’ But he replied, like, a second later. So I sent the girl $300 and he came on the podcast. <a href=#>Our video together</a> got so many views.”</p><p>One of those views was from Drake, who then started following her, she said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Drake during his chat with Bobbi Althoff on her podcast. <span class=credit>Youtube</span></figure><p>When that happened, she decided to “go for it and shoot my shot.” She sent Drake a direct message inviting him on her podcast, and he agreed.&nbsp;</p><p>“He sent me his touring schedule, and I knew that I needed to make it happen fast, so my friend and I flew to Memphis two days after the original DM was sent to record the episode.”</p><p>She missed her daughter’s first birthday to interview Drake.&nbsp;</p><p>Defending that choice, she told Cosmo, “We celebrated her birthday the weekend before, and she’s 1. She doesn’t know anything. It’s like any other day to her. People are so dramatic. They were like, ‘You did this for Drake?’ I don’t even know what my parents did for my first birthday. They probably worked. I know that I’m a good mom. It was work, and it was very much needed.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bobbi Althoff missed her child’s birthday to interview Drake in bed. <span class=credit>Youtube</span></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Because of her abrupt rise to fame between April and August, there has even been speculation that she is an “industry plant,” backed by Hollywood insiders. She mocked that rumor by<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> posting a TikTok video</a> of herself dancing to “Barbie World” by Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj, with a caption reading “celebrating because the industry planted me.”&nbsp;</p><p>She told Cosmo that she does have connections to Snoop Dogg, but is no “nepo baby,” as some of her critics have speculated.</p><p>“My dad’s a contractor, and he was working on Snoop Dogg’s neighbor’s house…I could not be further from someone with connections and with money. People are like, ‘Her dad had connections with Snoop Dogg.’ My dad was a handyman.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite denying that she is “someone with money,” she admitted that she self-funds her flights for her podcast, and she did not specify where she gets $300 to regularly offer to influencers to come on her podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Althoff, married to computer programmer Cory Althoff and the mother of two daughtersf, has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">previously said</a> on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Portny’s BFF Podcast</a> that she and her husband sleep separately, as she sleeps with their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>“I like dry humor; that’s what comes most naturally for me, so I want to see where that takes me,” she told Cosmo.&nbsp;</p><p>“I would love to get into acting. That’s definitely where I see myself going … I know that at any moment, my 10 seconds of fame could die down, and then what? But it doesn’t matter because my life is bigger than me. My kids are my purpose, and if I have to get a job at freakin’ McDonald’s after all of this, that’s what I’ll do.”</p><p>Althoff and Drake did not respond when The Post reached out for comment.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fmam9fmb%2Bit8SsZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2FHoqdmr5mptW6uzpuZomWRocGpu8WfZKKmXZZ6s8HMqKmenF2bsrawjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-fix-robot-vacuum-not-moving.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to fix a robot vacuum that stops moving">&larr;
