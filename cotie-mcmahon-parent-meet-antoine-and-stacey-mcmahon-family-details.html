Her parents have been huge supporters and influencers throughout her career. Cotie McMahon is an American college basketball player who represents the Ohio State Buckeyes in the Big Ten Conference.</p><p>She dominated the basketball court, leading her team to the Greater Western Ohio Conference championship and earning a four-star rating from ESPN. McMahon, who entered at Ohio State at the age of 17, made an immediate impact as a rookie, garnering second-team All-Big Ten honours and the coveted Big Ten Rookie of the Year title.</p><p>In her debut NCAA tournament, she led Ohio State to the Elite Eight, leaving an indelible impression as a dynamic player with a penchant for big circumstances.

He’s always told me that I can accomplish everything I set my mind to.</strong></p><p>Moving on, McMahon’s mother, Stacey, introduced her to basketball when she was younger. Stacey has played a vital role in encouraging and advancing Cotie’s basketball career. Cotie revealed that she was initially indifferent in basketball until her mother pushed her to try it. McMahon stated that her mother was the one who took her to the gym and rehearsed for hours.</p><p>During an interview, she explained:</p><p><strong>“She always pushed me to work harder. She was constantly forcing me to play against boys or older girls. She was continuously having me do more exercises or shots.”</strong></p><p>Cotie McMahon is fortunate to have such supportive parents. She also frequently shows gratitude and honours her parents for her accomplishments.</p><h2>Cotie McMahon Siblings</h2><p>Cotie McMahon grew up with four siblings.
