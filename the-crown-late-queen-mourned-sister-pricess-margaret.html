The heartbreaking episode detailed a magical moment from Margaret and<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II</a>’s youth where they enjoyed one night of freedom at The Ritz hotel, interspersed with Margaret’s increasingly difficult health struggles including several strokes, scalding her feet and dealing with paralysis. So what happened?&nbsp;</p><p id=e5Gzm9jND5J data-wc=69>Since The Crown is fictional while rooted in reality, several moments of the episode is made up of manufactured conversations between the Queen and Margaret, including the late monarch purchasing her sister a walking stick, and reading children's stories to her while she was ill. The final statement from the episode reads: "Princess Margaret died peacefully in her sleep at 6:30 am on 9th February 2002. She was 71."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The Crown season six part two official trailer</figure><p id=eXZx9mXm4aW data-wc=50>In reality, the Queen mourned very privately for Margaret, with Charles giving a speech about his aunt to the public following her death. He said: "This is a terribly sad day for all of my family, but particularly of course for the Queen, my mama and grandmother, the Queen Mother.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8685ac616c32-gettyimages-509764078.jpg><p id=eBY7aJ7m9yC data-wc=66>"For Princess Margaret’s children, David and Sarah, and also my aunt’s wonderful friends who, like all of us, will miss her deeply.

Mine were very much a part of my life and always gave me their support and encouragement… But my own sadness was tempered by the generous tributes that so many of you paid to the service they gave to this country and the wider Commonwealth.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eShgk7rkcnTb data-wc=29>"At such a difficult time this gave me great comfort and inspiration as I faced up both to my own personal loss and to the busy Jubilee summer ahead."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7d616eb68c4a-princess-margaret.jpg><p id=e9NfICXkDiIQ data-wc=47>The Princess’s funeral was held at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, on the same day as her father King George VI was buried, 50 years earlier, and in the same place.

She died one month later.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c03fbcf218a0-the-crown-margaret.jpg><p id=eVnPfmmzL9qB data-wc=62>According to the BBC, the Queen spent an hour paying her respects at Margaret’s coffin, before she was moved to St James’s Palace. She was cremated, which was unusual for members of the royal family, but believed to be part of her wishes, which was referenced in The Crown, as she detailed to her sister what she would like for the funeral.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ3JtYGt8tbTEZpqrp6ejeq2t055kqq2Vmrtuuc6uqaedlGLAqr%2FTnqlmqKKesKa%2F0makmqqXlr%2BmwI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities-depression-anxiety-mental-health.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="39 Celebrities Who Have Opened Up About Mental Health">&larr;
