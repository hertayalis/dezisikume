In 2019, she purchased a $3.7 million brownstone home in Franklin, Tennessee, after moving out of her longtime home in Connecticut. The house boasts 9,000 square feet of living space and is located in an exclusive suburb on the outskirts of Nashville.</p><p>Less than a year before this purchase, Gifford bought another brownstone home in the same area for the same amount. This second property is smaller than the first, with a square footage of 7,965.</p><p>In 1998, Kathie Lee and her husband purchased an oceanfront property in Nantucket for $5.8 million. The couple initially bought a different Nantucket property, but it was too close to the sidewalk and didn’t offer enough privacy.</p><p>In 2018, Gifford sold a property in Key Largo, Florida, which she inherited as part of her late husband’s estate. The 11,419-square-foot mansion was initially purchased in 1998 for $3.9 million. After failing to find a buyer, Gifford relisted the home in 2018 for $10.5 million.</p><p>Despite the passing of her husband, Gifford continued to live in her $22 million mansion in Connecticut. The Spanish revival home is situated in the exclusive Riverside neighborhood of Greenwich and features a sprawling lawn. The property suffered significant damage during Hurricane Katrina, and Gifford eventually decided to move out, stating that it felt “lonely” and “like a morgue.” However, she has not sold the property and reportedly has no plans to do so.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC3wK2fop1dobKmecainZ%2Bnopl6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./latavia-roberson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LaTavia Roberson">&larr;
